# ExtractGPX

Extracts the GPS data from an MP4 file and writes it to a GPX file.

# Usage

```
ExtractGPX mp4-file-name [gpx-file-name]
```

If the GPX file name is not specified, it will be created by replacing the MP4 file name extension with GPX. So
```
ExtractGPX MyVideo.mp4
```
would produce a file named __MyVideo.gpx__.
